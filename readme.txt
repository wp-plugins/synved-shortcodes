An amazing free set of great elements for your site: SEO-ready tabs, sections, buttons, links to any content, author cards, lists, layouts and more!

== Description ==

[WordPress Shortcodes](http://synved.com/wordpress-shortcodes/ "WordPress Shortcodes – beautiful elements to spice up your site") is a free WordPress plugin that brings an amazing set of beautiful and useful elements to your site. The plugin comes bundled with the full set of elements, all absolutely free of charge.

> #### Eager to get a functioning example of how the shortcodes elements look and feel?
> Look at some basic example shortcodes on the [Stripefolio demo site](http://wpdemo.synved.com/stripefolio/shortcodes/). Note that the demo site only presents a limited subset, the best way to test the full set is to install the plugin and try it yourself!

If you want to take it to the next level and hugely improve the appearance of the elements and make them look more professional, you might want to consider purchasing the [SlickPanel skin](http://synved.com/product/wordpress-shortcodes-slickpanel-skin/ "Transform the look of many elements in the Shortcodes plugin!").

There are many different kinds of elements that cover for all your requirements. These include functionality for *User Interface creation*, *Layout management*, *Lists*, *Buttons*, *Message boxes*, *smart links* to easily link contents on your site without using full URLs but with IDs or names and a bunch of other useful tools.

Just use the intuitive shortcode editor to create a message box, error box or warning message on your site. Or create multi-column layouts, a fancy button, a highly stylized link card, a list of items with icons (like a feature list), or combine multiple nested shortcodes to create for instance a list of links or a list of buttons and much more.

The shortcode editor presents a very intuitive and easy to use interface, with many built-in presets that make inserting many commonly needed default shortcodes in your posts/pages a breeze! If you want you can also get [over 30+ extra useful amazing presets](http://synved.com/product/wordpress-shortcodes-extra-presets/) for covering almost all needs.

The plugin offers all common jQuery UI functionality as well like jQuery UI Accordions, JQuery UI Tabs, jQuery UI buttons and so on. The UI tabs provide many different features including full SEO compatible selection of active tab without need for JavaScript.
